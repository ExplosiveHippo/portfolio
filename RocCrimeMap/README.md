RocCrimeMap
===========

[Current Demo](http://www.lancealaughlin.com/RocCrimeMap/)

RocCrimeMap gets a feed of recent violent crimes in Rochester, NY and plots them on a Leaflet map. Also draws a shapefile of Rochester Neighborhoods. Eventually, they will be color coded based on the crime activity.


Requirements
===========
You must upload to a server in order to get the shape file to show. Not entirely sure why. I think it's something with the library that converts the shape file to a GeoJson file.


Data
===========
Currently I do not have access to a live data source for this feed so the data is static and/or out of date.
